      <p>
        If you would like the phone number for local Crisis Lines or Help Lines, please
        click below and answer the questions.<br>
        <strong>If you or someone you know are in immediate danger, please call 9-1-1 or your
        local law enforcement.</strong><br><br>
        If you call your local Crisis Line, they will ask for your information so your county
        of residence can follow up with you to ensure you have the resources you need; knowing
        your natural supports is helpful when calling your Crisis Line.<br>
        If you are in need of using a Crisis Line, call the phone number for the county where 
        you are currently located, not your county of residence if they are not the same. 
      </p>
