    <h1>Mental Health</h1>
    <p>
     Mental health is a topic that is often not discussed. 
     When you are struggling with mental health concerns it is extremely important 
     to know your natural supports. <br>
     A natural supports are defined as "personal associations and relationships 
     typically developed in the community that enhance the quality and security 
     of life for people, including, but not limited to, family relationships; 
     friendships reflecting the diversity of the neighborhood and the community; 
     association with fellow students or employees in regular classrooms and 
     work places, and associations developed though participation in clubs, 
     organizations, and other civic activities." (http://www.dds.ca.gov/Publications/docs/Natural_Supports.pdf)<br><br>
     Having natural supports makes a substantial impact on crisis and non-crisis situations.
