Problem Statement:
A program that defines "natural supports" and prompts the user to list their own natural supports.
If the user wants additional information on what to do if they have no natural supports, or their
natural supports are unavailable, it will prompt them to answer questions regarding their current mental health.
If appropriate the user will be provided with contact information for local resources (in Wisconsin) which could be
either their county's crisis line or a talk-line.
